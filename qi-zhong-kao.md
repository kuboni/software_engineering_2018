### **Q1. Why and What is Software engineering?**

A1. 

We need software engineering since we concerned about:

1. why it takes so long to accomplish a software project
2. why development cost so high
3. why can't we find all error before hand in software to customers
4. why is it difficult to measure process as software developing

{% hint style="info" %}
summarize:

1. time
2. cost
3. error
4. measuring
{% endhint %}

 So, software engineering is :

> ### **A manageable, technological discipline \(學科\) to help us finished software product on time and within cost constrain**.

### **Q2. What is Software \(at least 3 points\) ?**

A2. 

Software = Computer program\(Code\) + Data + Documents

### **Q3. What is characteristics of Software ?**

A3.

1. engineered
2. custom-built
3. won't wear out
4. changeable
5. invisible
6. tolerance
7. can be metrics

### **Q4. What is the myths of software?**

A4.

The myth of software can be divide into three primary part:

1. manage
2. customer
3. engineers \(practitioner\)

### **Q5. Please answer what and who is stakeholder**

A5.

Stakeholder is people involved in project who has stake in successful outcome. People that stand for stakeholder are:

1. senior manager \( 高階管理者 \)
2. project manager \( techniques \)
3. customers
4. practitioners
5. end-users



### **Q6. What is CMMI? and how does it work?**

A6.

CMMI stands for " Capability Maturity Model Integration ", it is a measure method designed by CMU for NASA. It helps us know that how "mature" is a project team\(company\) or specified to the maturity of project.

CMMI offered two representing ways. One is "staged" and the other is "continues". Also, CMMI divides process areas as PAs. PAs are different aspect of a process.

### Q7. Please describe different type of process model

A7.

There are three types of common process models mentioned in textbook. They are respectively **linear sequential model** \(or so called waterfall model\), **RAD model** \(rapid application development model\), and **evolutionary software process model**. 

Evolutionary software process model contains :

1. prototyping model
2. incremental model
3. spiral model
4. component-based development model

### Q8. Please compare RAD model and waterfall model

A8.

|  | waterfall model | RAD model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 人力 | 較少 | 較多 |
| 模組化 | 不需要 | Yes |
| 時間 | 長 | 短 |
| 花費 | 低 | 高 |
| 執行難度 | 較低 | 較高 |
| 整合 | No | Yes |
| 錯誤放大 | 明顯 | 不明顯 |

### Q9. What is the evolutionary model. Please describe it and answer why it called evolutionary.

A9.

使用evolutionary model提供我們更多的彈性並提高監督process進行的能力。evolutionary model會在一定時間或階段結束時，檢視我們的process狀態，透過評估對下一階段的狀態進行計畫。

在教科書中題到了幾種常見的evolutionary model，其中包含：

* prototype model
  * 適用於軟體開發初期
  * 流程（對於每項功能）
    * 傾聽顧客需求
    * 針對需求撰寫
    * 檢視成品與顧客要求是否一致（與顧客討論），回到第一步
* incremental model
  * pipeline
  * 使用此模型時
    * 需要將process模組化
    * 因為可以快速推出新功能，對於搶客戶而言相當有利

Q10

* please describe project associative people of CC, CD, DD.

Q11

* What is two method of software quality factor metrics 

Q12

* Why project planning resources

Q13

* What is OTS planning method, CPM floattime gantte

Q14

* Why we need risk management?
